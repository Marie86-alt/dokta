The AI engineer successfully built a React Native Expo application for medical appointment booking, named MediBook Cameroun, which was later rebranded to DOKTA. The development progressed through several phases: initial setup, backend API implementation for user, doctor, and appointment management, and frontend development for patient and doctor interfaces. Key features like specialty selection, doctor listing, appointment scheduling, and a simulated Mobile Money payment were implemented. The engineer then focused on enhancing the doctor interface and addressing navigation bugs. Most recently, the application's UI was revamped to mimic Doctolib, integrating a global search bar on the homepage, and establishing a 5-tab navigation system for both patient and doctor roles. The current state involves refining this new Doctolib-like homepage and ensuring all elements are correctly linked and styled.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a medical appointment booking mobile application for Cameroon using React Native Expo, featuring patient/practitioner account creation (without authentication initially), online slot booking with an integrated calendar, teleconsultation (WebRTC/Zoom API), secure online payment (Mobile Money for Cameroon), and push notifications.

The initial implementation focused on online slot booking and mobile money payment. The app, initially MediBook Cameroun, was later rebranded to DOKTA.

**Implemented Features:**
- **Backend:** FastAPI with MongoDB, managing users, doctors, appointments, 8 medical specialties, slot scheduling (9h-17h, 12h-14h break), doctor pricing, and demo data.
- **Frontend (Patient):** Home screen (Patient/Doctor choice), specialty selection, doctor listing with prices, appointment calendar, patient form, simulated Mobile Money payment (MTN/Orange), booking confirmation.
- **Frontend (Doctor):** Login, Dashboard, Appointment management, Patient management, Availability management, Profile.
- **Global Search:** Ability to search for both patients and doctors from a central search bar.
- **UI/UX:** Mobile-first, intuitive navigation, French language, Cameroonian validation (+237), responsive design, 5-tab navigation for both patient and doctor (Home, Appointments, Documents, Messages, Profile/Account).
- **Latest Request:** Redesign the homepage to resemble Doctolib, with the global search prominently displayed, and integrate the 5-tab navigation directly from the home screen, including a floating button for doctor access and an account creation page.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture with an Expo frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.



-   : Contains the FastAPI backend logic, including routes for users, doctors, appointments, search, and data models for MongoDB. Recently updated for global search and fixing a 422 error in appointment status update.
-   : This is the primary entry point. It has been significantly modified to act as the DOKTA homepage, featuring a global search bar, and integrating the main navigation between patient and doctor interfaces and the new tab system.
-   : Main dashboard for doctors, providing navigation to their specific functionalities. It was recently modified to correct navigation issues to doctor-specific pages like profile, patients, and availability.
-   : Defines the tab-based navigation for the patient interface, encompassing Accueil, Rendez-vous, Documents, Messages, and Profil. This was created as a new approach to tab navigation after issues with nested routes.
-   : Defines the tab-based navigation for the doctor interface, including Tableau de Bord, Rendez-vous, Documents, Patients, and Param√®tres. Also created as part of the simplified tab navigation.
-   : A dedicated page for global search functionality, allowing users to search for doctors, patients, and specialties. It was recently connected to the backend API.

Changes have focused on establishing a robust navigation structure with  and , ensuring proper routing, API integration, and user experience.

<current_work>
The most recent work involved a major UI overhaul based on the user's request to make the application (rebranded DOKTA) resemble Doctolib. This included:
1.  **Homepage Redesign ():** The primary  file was completely refactored to serve as the new DOKTA homepage. It now prominently features a global search bar, as requested, and integrates the main navigation points, including access to the new tab-based interfaces for patients and doctors.
2.  **Global Search Integration:** The global search functionality () was further integrated into the main patient interface. The backend API () for global search (doctors by name/specialty, specialties, patients) has been implemented and tested successfully.
3.  **Floating Doctor Button:** A floating button is being added to allow doctors to easily access their specific interface from the patient-facing homepage.
4.  **Account Creation Page:** A page for creating accounts is being added within the new Compte (Account) tab.
The AI is currently working on styling and ensuring the new homepage, search bar, and navigation elements are correctly rendered and functional according to the Doctolib-like design. The last action involved adding missing styles for the search placeholder.

<optional_next_step>
Add the remaining styles and functionality for the floating doctor button and the account creation page.
