The AI engineer's work involved an iterative process of feature implementation, UI/UX refinement, and bug fixing based on user feedback. Initially, the focus was on a Doctolib-like redesign of the homepage, integrating global search and tab navigation. This led to issues like a white screen (CORS error) and search results visibility, which were subsequently fixed. A major point was ensuring the work was on the user's specific GitHub version, leading to multiple resets and re-application of changes. Following UI stabilization, JWT authentication for both backend and frontend was implemented. Recent efforts concentrated on refining the home screen layout (removing Services rapides, centering title), restructuring the appointment booking flow (doctor profile, patient selection, calendar), and fixing persistent UI bugs related to search result visibility and clickability of consultation options on doctor profiles. The last actions addressed the size of the Médecins recommandés section and the non-functional consultation buttons.

The user initially requested a React Native Expo medical appointment booking app for Cameroon, named MediBook Cameroun (rebranded to DOKTA). Key features include patient/practitioner accounts, online slot booking with calendar, teleconsultation, secure Mobile Money payment, and push notifications. The app needs to be mobile-first, in French, support Cameroonian validation (+237), and offer an intuitive UI/UX.

Implemented so far: FastAPI backend with MongoDB for users, doctors, appointments, specialties, and scheduling. Frontend includes patient home, specialty/doctor listing, appointment calendar, patient form, simulated Mobile Money, and booking confirmation. Doctor features: login, dashboard, appointment/patient/availability management, profile. Global search for doctors, patients, specialties. The UI has been heavily redesigned to mimic Doctolib, featuring a prominent global search bar on the homepage, a 5-tab navigation system for both patient (Accueil, Rendez-vous, Documents, Messages, Compte) and doctor roles, a floating doctor access button, and an integrated account creation/login flow. The appointment flow now guides from doctor search to a detailed profile, patient selection, and an improved calendar.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a full-stack architecture: Expo (React Native) for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and MongoDB as the database.



- ****: The core FastAPI backend. It was updated to integrate JWT authentication routes (), define models for users (Patient/Doctor), and add/refine API endpoints for appointment creation () and fetching individual doctor profiles ().
- ****: A new file created to encapsulate JWT authentication logic, including user models, password hashing (bcrypt), token generation/validation, and dependency injection for FastAPI security.
- ****: The main Expo Router layout. This file was modified to wrap the application with the  to manage global authentication state, allowing secured routes and context-based access to user information.
- ****: The main entry point and DOKTA homepage. This file has undergone extensive changes. It features the global search, handles navigation between patient/doctor interfaces, dynamically renders content based on active tabs, and was recently modified to adjust the layout of Médecins recommandés and remove Services rapides. It also integrated the  to display user profiles when authenticated.
- ****: A new page created for user (patient/doctor) login. It includes form fields for phone number and password, along with navigation to the registration page.
- ****: A new page for user registration. It allows patients/doctors to create accounts with phone numbers, names, passwords, and other relevant details.
- ****: A new file that provides a React Context for authentication. It manages user login/logout, stores authentication tokens, and provides user data across the application.
- ****: A new dynamic route for displaying a detailed doctor profile. It shows the doctor's address, presentation, consultation options (cabinet, domicile, téléconsultation), and buttons for messaging/booking. Recent changes focused on fixing click interception for consultation buttons.
- ****: A new page to allow an authenticated user to select a patient (themselves or a family member) for an appointment.
- ****: A new page for selecting the consultation date and time, dynamically fetching doctor availabilities and allowing appointment confirmation.

Changes have focused on establishing a robust navigation structure with  and , ensuring proper routing, API integration, and user experience.

The AI engineer's most recent work addressed multiple critical UI and functionality issues reported by the user. Specifically, it involved:
1.  **Search Results Display Fix:** Corrected an issue where search results were not visible due to layout conflicts. This involved adjusting the  and elevation of the search results overlay in  to ensure it renders above other content.
2.  **Blue Outline on Input Fields:** Removed the distracting blue outline that appeared on focus for  components in authentication pages ( and ) by adding .
3.  **Services rapides Section Removal:** Removed the Services rapides section from the homepage () as per user request, simplifying the interface.
4.  **Médecins recommandés Section Resizing:** Reduced the visual size and prominence of the Médecins recommandés section on the homepage () by limiting the number of displayed doctors, reducing avatar sizes, and compacting card padding/margins.
5.  **Doctor Profile Consultation Button Fix:** Diagnosed and fixed a click interception issue on the doctor profile page () that prevented the Téléconsultation and Consultation à domicile buttons from being clickable. This was resolved by adjusting the  of the parent  and adding debugging checks for  object presence.
6.  **Confirmer le rendez-vous Functionality:** Implemented the  backend API route () to handle appointment creation, which was previously causing the Confirmer le rendez-vous button on the calendar page () to do nothing. The API now handles appointment data and availability.

The application currently has a functional homepage, authentication, a refined doctor search and booking flow, and the latest UI/UX issues have been addressed. The AI engineer has asked the user to manually test the fixes for the consultation buttons.

<optional_next_step>
Await user confirmation on the latest fixes for the doctor profile consultation buttons and the Médecins recommandés section. If confirmed, proceed with real Mobile Money integration as previously prioritized.
